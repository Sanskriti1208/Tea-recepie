STEP 1: Boil water.
Different types of tea require different water temperature to brew. Check the tea packaging to see the recommended water temperature.
Black tea is steeped in boiling hot water. Instead of boiling water on a stovetop, I use my trusty electric kettle with temperature setting and set it to 208°F.


STEP 2: Warm up teapot.
This step is a detail that takes your tea to the next level and almost no one does it. But they should.
Fill half the teapot with hot water and give it a few swirls.
We’re warming the teapot so that when the hot water for tea goes in, the water temperature won’t drop too much.
Once the teapot has warmed after a few seconds, throw out the water.


STEP 3: Put tea into teapot and add hot water.
Figure out how much water your teapot holds and add the right amount of tea.
For every cup, add 1.5 teaspoons of tea.
You can use this Perfect Tea Measuring Spoon which will measure out 1.5 teaspoons per scoop.


STEP 4: Cover teapot and steep tea.
Set the timer on your phone to steep it to the correct amount of time.
The steep time is different for each kind of tea so check the tea package to see what is recommended.
Usually it’s no more than 5 minutes.


STEP 5: Strain tea solids and pour hot tea into tea cups.
PRO TIP: Hold onto the teapot lid with a finger so that it doesn’t fall off as you’re pouring.
Add milk or sugar if drinking oolong or black tea. Don’t add milk or sugar if you’re drinking green or white tea. (Please, no.)
I’m using a tea strainer so that I can filter out the tea leaves, but if your teapot has an infuser there’s no need for one.
